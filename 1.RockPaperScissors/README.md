## ðŸ“œ **Description**
This project is a **command-line version of Rock-Paper-Scissors**. The user plays against a computer opponent that makes its move randomly. The game continues in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

- The user can choose:
  - `r` for **Rock**
  - `p` for **Paper**
  - `s` for **Scissors**
  - `q` to **Quit the game**
- The computer randomly selects one of the three moves.
- The winner is determined based on standard **Rock-Paper-Scissors** rules:
  - Rock beats Scissors (`r > s`)
  - Scissors beat Paper (`s > p`)
  - Paper beats Rock (`p > r`)
  - The same moves result in a **draw**.
